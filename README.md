    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The Project required me to create 2 clocks 1 of which was 12 hours and the other 24 hours.
    
    What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did the edits to the time well because I used cases rather than several if statements. Before I would have inefficiently used up extra memory on more if statements!
    
    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my code more within the clock times themselves. Currently they are set to arbitrary time because I lack the knowledge to use the time set on the user's computer. I have done research on this and the method is still above my head.
    
    Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are                            you adding to your support network?
I found interperating the instructions to be challenging. I oftentimes found myself going above and beyond in some  areas where I didn't need to as well as not doing enough in areas I thought I didn't have to do as much in. Communication is key within the computer science world and if I can't understand what is asked of me this will be a hard job to uptake!
    
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Modularity while making the code will be essential to other projects. I tried to take this project in small bites so that I could test early and test often. This was very useful and I intend to take this skill to all other projects and code that I write in the future.
    
    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried explaing what was happening to my family. If they (with no background knowledge) could understand it then that means other computer scientists should be able to as well. If not, I had to add more comments to explain what each part did.

    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was a system created and designed to enable a driving tutoring service through driving tests and                                                             driving reservations. Our client is an entrepenuer looking to fill a gap in the market where they feel there is little support for tutoring new drivers.

    What did you do particularly well?
I feel I encompased the client's requests particulary well because I referred back to the interview transcript for reference every time.

    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? 
I would revise the business requirements document.

    How would you improve it?
I would improve the document by ensuring the wording is more precise. I felt as if since I was learning the terminology I wasn't very efficient or organized with which category I placed and explained some requirements.
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? 
I interpreted the user's needs by using my own experience with websites as well as my peers. For example, I have heard many stories about colorblind issues with websites and many more accessability problems the user would need solutions to within the system.

    Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The users are the main reason the system is created. This means they will be using the system more than anyone else in the world. Should the system's design be flawed or missing the user's needs, the system would be effectively useless in that regard.

    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design  a system?
When designing software, I approach with the future in mind. I prefer to loosely plan ahead so there are always ideas ahead to think about. If I am having trouble with a certain part of the design I would like to have something else I can move on to and come back with a fresh view. In order to analyze and design a system, I would certainly use some of these UML diagrams, especially the sequence diagram. The sequence diagram breaks things down into transactions rather than one big system which helps me think modularly about each situation.

    Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
My client, Artemis Financial, is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. The issue to be addressed is that I must take their current software application and add secure communication mechanisms to meet their software security requirements. I should deliver a production quality integrated application that includes secure coding protocols.
    
    What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I feel as though I did well identifying each of the security vulnerabilities by individially. When taken methodically, each vulnerability got more thorougly addressed. It is important to code securely to limit surface area for attacks or vulnerabilities within a system. Software security adds safety for both the client and the clientele's data, maintaining trust and protecting all users of the system.
    
    What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
While working through the vulnerability assessment, I found it challenging to locate a place to start. I wanted to look into several vulnerabilities at the same time or assess things out of order because some were faster to do than others. In contrast I found it helpful to follow the order because that way I can be more scrupulous and complete in my assessment. It is better to be this way because otherwise I could miss something and leave a critical vulnerability unchecked.
    
    How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
I approached the need to increase layers of security meticulously. First, analysis. I had to find what was already present. After that was assessment. I had to find what needed implementing as well as what could use more work. In the future, I would like to continue using techniques and strategies such as analyze and assess and the vulnerability assessment report in the future because they are helpful with being thorough and efficient when increasing layers of security. 
    
    How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To ensure the code and software application were functional and secure, I had to test early and test often. After refactoring the code I had to run the code without errors as well as well as perform another dependancy check to assess any dependancies I added for known weaknesses on the CDC.
    
    What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Some of the tools or resources I used that I might find helpful in the future would be the vulnerability assessment chart and the maven dependacy check. These were helpful in finding vulnerabilities within the system as well as ensure that I am not adding more vulnerabilities where I refactored the system.
    
    Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
I might want to showcase my skills, knowledge, and experience involved in implementing the SHA-2 cipher. I feel like that work includes some of my better coding practices. While I am not too familiar with maven currently, my prior work with Java as well as research helped me properly implement a cipher that avoids collisions and provides security to Artemis Financial.

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I try to ensure my code, program, or software is function and secure, I focus on testing early and testing often. I try to test each block of code after I add it rather than doing the entire program and then finding out I am getting unexpected results. In doing so, I also have to reference the rubric often so that I am including only what is asked of me as well as ensures I am encluding everything that fits that request. For my programs to be functional, they must fulfill all of the functions that they are intended to.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Outside of my frequent referencing of the rubric which I use as the user needs for these assignments, I also ask the instructor for more clarification whenever I am ever unsure of the intentions based upon my interpretation. One of the most important aspects of programming is fulfilling the intended purpose of the code, and misinterpretations interfere with this.

How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I prefer to come up with an efficient method and troubleshoot problems as I notice them. It is not until I notice a fatal flaw that reduces effectiveness that I will change the direction of the software design severely since due to time constraints I usually do not have the luxery of restarting to increase efficiency nor does the effeciency effect these smaller projects. It does bother me to use inefficient methods however, so I try to start with a more effecient base design in the future if I come across a less than effecient design but still effective in the process.

Fourth Repository for SNHU Class



How do I approach designing software?
    I approach designing software with clarity in mind. One of the most important factors for progamming efficieny is to be able to not only read the code easily, but understand it's functions. With that in mind, I make sure that my methods are not convoluted or round-a-bout so that I do not make simple mistakes during development as well as so my teachers can understand the code while helping me or grading the assignment.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
My work on the project has helped me craft sectioning as a design skill. I often found myself trying to add more than one function at a time, or making progress on other parts of the code before finishing the one im on. I will now be more cautious about sectioning off work.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I applied my typical approach for clarity in this project.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
In future work, designing with clarity in mind will continue to be beneficial. Even if the clarity doesn't help me, other programmers will appreciate method design they can understand when they need to make changes to my program in the future.

How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing programs by testing early and often. I ran the code as often as I could when I made changes in hopes to see the effects of as many individual lines of code as possible. Due to this I have caught many mistakes early in development.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
While working on my 3D scene, I applied a new building block strategy where I add the new functionality I learned from other assignments into my 3D scene.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration factored into my development because I had to build on my 3D scene in 'building blocks'. That meant my 3D scene underwent many interations over the course of development.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
The building block strategy is not one I have mastered yet, but has been a valuable tool which led me to the project's completion. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
My goal is to become a computer scientist in the future, which means computer science is necessary for reaching my goals.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
In future pathways, the knowledge and skills I gained will give me a better understanding of future content in my educational pathway that I wll reference in the future.
       
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
While I am currently unsure of what specialization I want to partake in as a computer scientiest, I will be using the skills and knowledge from graphics and visualizations to decide on and wortk toward that specialization in the future.
