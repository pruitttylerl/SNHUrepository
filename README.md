First Repository for SNHU class

    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The Project required me to create 2 clocks 1 of which was 12 hours and the other 24 hours.
    
    What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did the edits to the time well because I used cases rather than several if statements. Before I would have inefficiently used up extra memory on more if statements!
    
    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my code more within the clock times themselves. Currently they are set to arbitrary time because I lack the knowledge to use the time set on the user's computer. I have done research on this and the method is still above my head.
    
    Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are                            you adding to your support network?
I found interperating the instructions to be challenging. I oftentimes found myself going above and beyond in some  areas where I didn't need to as well as not doing enough in areas I thought I didn't have to do as much in. Communication is key within the computer science world and if I can't understand what is asked of me this will be a hard job to uptake!
    
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Modularity while making the code will be essential to other projects. I tried to take this project in small bites so that I could test early and test often. This was very useful and I intend to take this skill to all other projects and code that I write in the future.
    
    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried explaing what was happening to my family. If they (with no background knowledge) could understand it then that means other computer scientists should be able to as well. If not, I had to add more comments to explain what each part did.

    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was a system created and designed to enable a driving tutoring service through driving tests and                                                             driving reservations. Our client is an entrepenuer looking to fill a gap in the market where they feel there is little support for tutoring new drivers.

    What did you do particularly well?
I feel I encompased the client's requests particulary well because I referred back to the interview transcript for reference every time.

    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? 
I would revise the business requirements document.

    How would you improve it?
I would improve the document by ensuring the wording is more precise. I felt as if since I was learning the terminology I wasn't very efficient or organized with which category I placed and explained some requirements.
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? 
I interpreted the user's needs by using my own experience with websites as well as my peers. For example, I have heard many stories about colorblind issues with websites and many more accessability problems the user would need solutions to within the system.

    Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The users are the main reason the system is created. This means they will be using the system more than anyone else in the world. Should the system's design be flawed or missing the user's needs, the system would be effectively useless in that regard.

    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design  a system?
When designing software, I approach with the future in mind. I prefer to loosely plan ahead so there are always ideas ahead to think about. If I am having trouble with a certain part of the design I would like to have something else I can move on to and come back with a fresh view. In order to analyze and design a system, I would certainly use some of these UML diagrams, especially the sequence diagram. The sequence diagram breaks things down into transactions rather than one big system which helps me think modularly about each situation.
