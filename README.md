First Repository for SNHU class

    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    The Project required me to create 2 clocks 1 of which was 12 hours and the other 24 hours.
    
    What did you do particularly well?
    I believe I did the edits to the time well because I used cases rather than several if statements. Before I would have inefficiently used up extra memory on more if statements!
    
    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    I could enhance my code more within the clock times themselves. Currently they are set to arbitrary time because I lack the knowledge to use the time set on the user's computer. I have done research on this and the method is still above my head.
    
    Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
    I found interperating the instructions to be challenging. I oftentimes found myself going above and beyond in some areas where I didn't need to as well as not doing enough in areas I thought I didn't have to do as much in. Communication is key within the computer science world and if I can't understand what is asked of me this will be a hard job to uptake!
    
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
    Modularity while making the code will be essential to other projects. I tried to take this project in small bites so that I could test early and test often. This was very useful and I intend to take this skill to all other projects and code that I write in the future.
    
    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    I tried explaing what was happening to my family. If they (with no background knowledge) could understand it then that means other computer scientists should be able to as well. If not, I had to add more comments to explain what each part did.
